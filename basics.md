## 🔄 How Does It Work?

Burp Suite acts as a **proxy** between your browser and the target web server. This enables:

- 🔍 **Capturing all HTTP/HTTPS traffic** between your browser and the server
- 🧬 **Modifying web requests** before they reach the target server
- 🧪 **Manipulating server responses** before they’re displayed in the browser

> This interception and manipulation is the **backbone of the framework**, allowing testers to discover vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, IDOR, CSRF, etc.

## 💡 Summary

Burp Suite empowers ethical hackers to:
- Intercept & analyze traffic
- Tamper with data
- Test security flaws
- Automate common vulnerability scans
